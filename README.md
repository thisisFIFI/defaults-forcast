This repository contains my code for a course project: Forecast of Customer Defaults for LU Credit Company.

The dataset was shared by my professor. There are 1130300 pieces records with 89 variables, including independent variable `default` and dependent variables giving the demorgraphical information, employment situation, and financial status of each customer.

$F1-score$ is selected as the model evaluation metric.
XGBoost Model and lightGBM are built in this project. 

In this repository, how I cleaned the data, build the model and tune the parameters can be found.
